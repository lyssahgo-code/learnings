# Journal — SEPTEMBER 13 — SQL AND ETL BASICS

## 1) What I learned (bullets, not prose)
- I learned that several processes are involved in each step of the ELT/ETL process
- I learned about the different database designs
- I learned that trade-offs would be something DE's encounter, mostly deciding based on business needs

## 2) New vocabulary (define in your own words)
- OLAP: data processing system best for historical analysis
- OLTP: data processing system best for recording transactions real-time

## 3) Data Engineering mindset applied (what principles did I use?)
- Trade-offs

## 4) Decisions & assumptions (why, alternatives, trade-offs)
- When we ran into an error due to databases not existing, we executed the SQL query to create the database insteaed
- After changes have been made to the database, we needed to refresh/re-apply the changes via Metabase Admin > Databases

## 5) Open questions (things I still don’t get)
- I still am a bit confused on how the whole process (dlt, dbt, clickhouse, scripts) were executed
- I am also a bit confused on the commands to run/why these commands are run

## 6) Next actions (small, doable steps)
- Study more about dlt, dbt, creating databases process
- Study more about common commands that are used during this process

## 7) Artifacts & links (code, queries, dashboards)
- N/a

### Mini reflection (3–5 sentences)
What surprised me? What would I do differently next time? What will I watch out for in production?
- I am surprised at the amount of time that would be spent on fixing errors when running certain commands. Also at how much goes on behind the scenes to the ELT/ETL process - turns out there's a lot of processes involved as opposed to having the dataset ready and just analyzing it. For next time, if in case I encounter another error, I would document it and take note of the alternative steps we took to resolve it. I will also watch out for executing any commands that could cause said errors - will try asking for assistance first if unsure.
